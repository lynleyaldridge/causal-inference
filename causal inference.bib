Think econometrics is boring? So it was once, but will be no more! Skipping theoretical tedium, we use real empirical questions to bring the numbers to life. Does an expensive private university education pay off with higher earnings? Does health insurance really make you healthier? Does legal drinking cost lives?

	abstract = {Though randomized control trials continue to serve as the “gold standard” of causal inference, they are neither feasible nor desirable in numerous instances. Even in the absence of randomized trials, higher education researchers have at their disposal several statistical tools for estimating causal relationships. One such method is difference-in-differences, a powerful and intuitive approach to causal evaluation that exploits variation in the timing and coverage of policies. The method lends itself well to studying higher education policies and initiatives, as these frequently diffuse over time and across space in ways that may permit for causal inference. Difference-in-differences has become one of the most widely used methods for causal inference in higher education research. We use this chapter to introduce new researchers to this method with an overview of difference-in-differences models, common threats to their validity, and robustness checks. We then present extensions of the method, including event study models and variation in treatment timing. We illustrate these methods throughout the chapter by analyzing the effect of hurricanes on enrollment at affected colleges using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and provide Stata code for replication of the analysis.},

Unfortunately, their decisions are rarely informed by evidence on the consequences of these initiatives in other settings. Nor are decisions typically accompanied by well-formulated plans to evaluate their causal impacts. As a result, knowledge about what works in different situations has been very slow to accumulate. Over the last several decades, advances in research methodology, administrative record keeping, and statistical software have dramatically increased the potential for researchers to conduct compelling evaluations of the causal impacts of educational interventions, and the number of well-designed studies is growing. Written in clear, concise prose, Methods Matter: Improving Causal Inference in Educational and Social Science Research offers essential guidance for those who evaluate educational policies. Using numerous examples of high-quality studies that have evaluated the causal impacts of important educational interventions, the authors go beyond the simple presentation of new analytical methods to discuss the controversies surrounding each study, and provide heuristic explanations that are also broadly accessible. Murnane and Willett offer strong methodological insights on causal inference, while also examining the consequences of a wide variety of educational policies implemented in the U.S. and abroad. Representing a unique contribution to the literature surrounding educational research, this landmark text will be invaluable for students and researchers in education and public policy, as well as those interested in social science.},

	abstract = {Since the start of the War on Poverty in the 1960s, social scientists have developed and refined experimental and quasi-experimental methods for evaluating and understanding the ways in which public policies, programs, and interventions affect people’s lives. The overarching mission of many social scientists is to understand “what works” in education and social policy. These are causal questions about whether an intervention, practice, program, or policy affects some outcome of interest. Although causal questions are not the only relevant questions in program evaluation, they are assumed by many in the fields of public health, economics, social policy, and now education to be the scientific foundation for evidence-based decision making. Fortunately, over the last half-century, two methodological advances have improved the rigor of social science approaches for making causal inferences. The first was acknowledging the primacy of research designs over statistical adjustment procedures. Donald Campbell and colleagues showed how research designs could be used to address many plausible threats to validity. The second methodological advancement was the use of potential outcomes to specify exact causal quantities of interest. This allowed researchers to think systematically about research design assumptions and to develop diagnostic measures for assessing when these assumptions are met. This article reviews important statistical methods for estimating the impact of interventions on outcomes in education settings, particularly programs that are implemented in field, rather than laboratory, settings. We begin by describing the causal inference challenge for evaluating program effects. Then four research designs are discussed that may be used for estimating program impacts. The article highlights what the Campbell tradition identifies as the strongest causal research designs: the randomized experiment and the regression-discontinuity designs. These approaches have the advantage of transparent assumptions for yielding causal effects. The article then discusses weaker but more commonly used approaches estimating effects, including the interrupted time series and the non-equivalent comparison group designs. For the interrupted time series design, differences-in-differences are discussed as a more generalized approach to time series methods; for non-equivalent comparison group designs, the article highlights propensity score matching as a method for creating statistically equivalent groups on the basis of observed covariates. For each research design, references are included that discuss the underlying theory and logic of the method, exemplars of the approach in field settings, and recent methodological extensions to the design. The article concludes with a discussion of practical considerations for evaluating interventions in field settings, including the external validity of estimated effects from impact studies.},

Although randomization is the current gold standard, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often limited in practice due to ethical and cost issues. Observational studies have also attracted a great deal of attention as, quite often, large historical datasets are available for these kinds of studies. However, observational studies also have their drawbacks, mainly including the systematic differences in baseline covariates, which relate to outcomes between treatment and control groups that can potentially bias results. Propensity score methods, which are a series of balancing methods in these studies, have become increasingly popular by virtue of the two major advantages of dimension reduction and design separation. Within this approach, propensity score matching (PSM) has been empirically proven, with outstanding performances across observational datasets. While PSM tutorials are available in the literature, there is still room for improvement. Some PSM tutorials provide step-by-step guidance, but only one or two packages have been covered, thereby limiting their scope and practicality. Several articles and books have expounded upon propensity scores in detail, exploring statistical principles and theories; however, the lack of explanations on function usage in programming language has made it difficult for researchers to understand and follow these materials. To this end, this tutorial was developed with a six-step PSM framework, in which we summarize the recent updates and provide step-by-step guidance to the R programming language. This tutorial offers researchers with a broad survey of PSM, ranging from data preprocessing to estimations of propensity scores, and from matching to analyses. We also explain generalized propensity scoring for multiple or continuous treatments, as well as time-dependent PSM. Lastly, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of propensity score methods.},
